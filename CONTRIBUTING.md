## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or for bug fixes:
   git checkout -b fix/issue-description
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards

3. **Run the linter** to check for issues:

   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

4. **Test your changes** locally and ensure everything works

5. **Commit your changes** with a clear, descriptive message:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new collaboration feature"
   git commit -m "fix: resolve navigation issue on mobile"
   ```

6. **Push your branch** to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Commit Message Guidelines

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a pull request** with a clear description of your changes
2. **Include context** about why the change is needed
3. **Reference any related issues** using keywords like "Fixes #123"
